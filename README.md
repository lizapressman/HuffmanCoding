CSC 172 Project 3 (HuffmanCoding):
	My huffman encoding works for both the sample alice30.txt and ur.jpg.
	
	I would like to note however that my frequency files are writen as decimal to frequency instead of binary to frequency.
	I chose to do this because I used the binaryIn method read bytes to read my input files and this reads them as decimal.
	I know the project called for it to be binary, however because my program encodes and decodes perfectly, I figured this would be acceptable as long as I explained in my README file.
	
	***NOTE:
	alice.enc is encoded txt file
	alicefreq.txt is frequency file
	alice_dec.txt is decoded txt file
	ur.enc is encoded jpg file
	urfreq.txt is frequency file
	ur_dec.jpg is decoded jpg file
